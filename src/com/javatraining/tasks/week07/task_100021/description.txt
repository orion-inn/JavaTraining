Simple Graph lib:
Supports 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
addEdge - adds edge to the graph
getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesn't have to be optimal)

Implement unit tests :

1) DirectedGraphTest
a) in a method with @Before annotation create some DirectedGraph
b) create pathShouldExist() test
c) create pathShouldNotExist() test

2) Same for UnDirectedGraphTest
