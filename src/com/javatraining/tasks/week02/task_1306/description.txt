Look at the program and fix it so it compiles and runs:
Move the implementation of the initializeIdAndName method to the User class.
Make the initializeIdAndName in the User class return the User type.

Requirements:
1. The DBObject interface must contain only the declaration of the initializeIdAndName method without an implementation.
2. Implement the initializeIdAndName method in the User class.
3. The initializeIdAndName method in the User class must have a return type of User.
4. The initializeIdAndName method must assign values to the id and name fields of the User object in accordance with the parameters passed to it and return this object.
