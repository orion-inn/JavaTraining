Fix 4 errors in the program so that it compiles.

Requirements:
1. Variables declared in an interface can only have the widest access level (public).
2. It is possible to extend only from a class: to implement interfaces, the keyword implements is used.
3. The Hobby class must be declared with the static access modifier.
4. To access the HOBBY variable, you do not need to create a Dream object.
5. Do not change interface declarations.
