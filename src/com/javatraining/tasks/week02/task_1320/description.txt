Implement the DBObject interface in the User class.
Implement the initializeIdAndName method so that the program runs and displays: "The user's name is Neo, id = 1".
The toString method and the main method cannot be changed.
Guess what the initializeIdAndName method in the User class should return.
Note that the toString() and main() methods cannot be changed.

Requirements:
1. The DBObject interface must be implemented in the User class.
2. The initializeIdAndName method must return a valid object of the User type, the object on which the method is called ("this" object).
3. The initializeIdAndName method must set the values of the id and name fields according to the parameters passed to it.
4. The program should display: "The user's name is Neo, id = 1".
5. Do not change the toString method.
6. Do not change the main method.
