Create a Bridge interface with int getCarsCount() method.
Create the WaterBridge and SuspensionBridge classes that implement the Bridge interface.
The getCarsCount() method must return any fixed int value.
The getCarsCount() method must return different values for different classes.
In Solution class, create a public println(Bridge bridge) method.
In println() method, print the getCarsCount() value for the bridge object to the console.
Each class and interface must be in separate files.

Requirements:
1. The Bridge interface must be created in a separate file.
2. The WaterBridge and SuspensionBridge classes must be created in separate files.
3. The WaterBridge and SuspensionBridge classes must implement the Bridge interface.
4. The getCarsCount() method must return different int values for different classes, but always a fixed (constant) value for different objects of the same class.
5. The Solution class must implement the public println method with one Bridge type parameter.
6. The println method should display in the console the number of cars (the result of the getCarsCount method) for the bridge passed to it (an object of type Bridge).
7. The int getCarsCount() method must be defined in the Bridge interface.
