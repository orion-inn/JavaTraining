A class is a singleton (implements the Singleton pattern) if it allows you to create only one object of its type.

Implement Singleton pattern:
Create a Singleton class in a separate file.
Add a static getInstance() method to it.
Any time the getInstance() method is called, it must return the same object of the Singleton class.
Think about how you can prevent the creation of other objects of this class.
Make all constructors in the Singleton class private.
As a result, it should be possible to create an object (an instance of a class) using only the getInstance method.
