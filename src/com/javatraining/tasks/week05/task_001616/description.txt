Write an implementation of the "run" method in the Stopwatch thread.
Stopwatch should count the number of seconds from thread creation to input a line from console.
Print the number of seconds to the console.

1. The "run" method of the Stopwatch class must contain a loop.
2. The "run" method must call Thread.sleep(1000).
3. The "run" method must increment the value of the "seconds" field by 1 every second.
4. After interrupting the Stopwatch thread (by calling the "interrupt" method), the "run" method should print the number of seconds to the console.
5. There should be only one "run" method in the Stopwatch class.
