Extension of week04.task_100001

- implement getShapes() getter in Box class
- turn Shape class into interface with only "double getVolume()" method
- remove the "volume" parameter from Shape, move the volume calculation from constructor to getVolume() method implementation (look at Pyramid class)
- read the description of java.util.Collections.sort() method to understand how the list of shapes can be sorted by Volume
- make the Shape interface implement the java.lang.Comparable interface
