Arrange synchronized blocks in the "secondMethod" so threads make a deadlock when using the Solution class.

1. The "secondMethod" must contain a synchronized block on "lock" object.
2. The "secondMethod" must contain a nested synchronized block on "this" object.
3. The "lock" field must be private.
4. The "secondMethod" method must not have "synchronized" modifier.
