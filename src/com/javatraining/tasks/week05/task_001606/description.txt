Figure out where and for which object you need to call the "join" method so that the result is displayed ordered :
for "firstThread" first and then for "secondThread".
Call the "join" method at proper place.

Sample output:
firstThread : String 1
firstThread : String 2
...
firstThread : String 19
firstThread : String 20
secondThread : String 1
...
secondThread : String 20

1. The main method must call the join method on the firstThread object.
2. The main method must not call the join method on the secondThread object.
3. The main method must not call System.out.println() or System.out.print().
