CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete.

The program starts with one of the following parameter sets:
-c name sex bd
-r id
-u id name sex bd
-d id

Parameters:
name - name, String
sex - gender, "m" or "f", one letter
bd - date of birth in the following format 15/04/1990
-c - adds a person with the given parameters to the end of allPeople, displays id (index) on the screen
-r - displays information about a person with id: name sex (m/f) bd (format 15-Apr-1990)
-u - updates the data of the person with the given id
-d - performs a logical removal of a person with id, replaces all his data with null

id corresponds to the index in the list.
All people should be stored in allPeople.
Use Locale.ENGLISH as the second parameter for SimpleDateFormat.

Parameter example:
-c Mironov m 15/04/1990

Sample output for the -r option:
Mironov m 15-Apr-1990

If the program is launched with parameters, then they fall into the args array (the argument of the main method is String[] args).
For example, when starting a program with parameters:
-c name sex bd
get in the main method
args[0] = "-c"
args[1] = "name"
args[2] = "sex"
args[3] = "bd"
To run code with parameters in the IntellijIDEA IDE, go to the Run -> Edit Configurations menu.

Requirements:
1. The Solution class must contain a public static field allPeople of type List<Person>.
2. The Solution class must contain a static block that adds two people to the allPeople list.
