User, Loser, Coder and Proger
1) Enter [in a loop] several lines from the keyboard (keys).
Keys can be: "user", "loser", "coder", "proger".
The input is over when the string does not match any of the above.
2) For the each line entered:
Create the appropriate object [see Person.java], for example, for the string "user" you need to create an object of the User class.
Pass this object to the doWork method.
3) Write an implementation of doWork method which:
Calls the live() method on the passed object if that object (person) is of type User.
Calls the doNothing() method if person is of type Loser.
Calls the writeCode() method if person is of type Coder.
Calls the enjoy() method if person is of type Proger.
