Declare and implement the logic of the private static method Set<Integer> getRadix(String number),
where you need to determine in which numeral systems (from 2 to 36) the representation of the "number" parameter (passed in decimal numeral system)
is a palindrome and add the index of such systems into the result.
If the passed number is incorrect, return an empty HashSet.
In number systems with a base greater than 10, Latin letters are used as digits.
For example, the decimal number 35 corresponds to the number "Z" in base-36 number system.
In the getRadix method, catch NumberFormatException.
