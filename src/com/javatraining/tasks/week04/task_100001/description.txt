Implement the hierarchy of classes as it shown on the picture
Each Shape has its volume.
The volume is calculated differently for different types of shapes
The Box class is a container, it can contain other shapes.
The add() method takes a Shape as input.
We should be able to add new shapes as long as there is enough space for them in the Box (only the volume is count, ignoring the type of shape).
If there is not enough space to add a new shape, then the method should return false.
