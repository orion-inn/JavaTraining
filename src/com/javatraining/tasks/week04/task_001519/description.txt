Different methods for different types
For this task you need:
Read data from the console until the word "exit" is entered.
For each value except "exit", call the print() method.
If the entered value:
- contains a dot '.', call the print() method for Double;
- greater than zero but less than 128, call the print() method for short;
- less than or equal to zero or greater than or equal to 128, call the print() method for Integer;
- otherwise, call the print() method for String.
