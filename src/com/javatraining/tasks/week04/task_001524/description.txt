Variable loading order
Figure out what and in what sequence is initialized in this program.
You could set breakpoints and use a debugger.
Correct the data initialization order so that the result should be as follows:

static void init()
static block
public static void main
non-static block
static void printAllFields
0
null
solution constructor
static void printAllFields
6
first name
