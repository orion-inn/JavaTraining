In Solution class, create a public static MyThreadFactory class that implements the ThreadFactory interface.
1. Implementation of the interface method - create and return a thread that should:
1.1. don't be a daemon
1.2. have normal priority,
1.3. the thread name must have the pattern "GN-pool-A-thread-B", where :
GN - is the group name,
A - is the factory number incremented within the class starting from 1, use AtomicInteger,
B - thread number is incremented within a specific factory starting from 1, use AtomicInteger.
2. Each factory must have the same ThreadGroup where it was created.

Sample output:
secondGroup-pool-2-thread-1
firstGroup-pool-1-thread-1
firstGroup-pool-1-thread-3
secondGroup-pool-2-thread-3
firstGroup-pool-1-thread-2
secondGroup-pool-2-thread-2
