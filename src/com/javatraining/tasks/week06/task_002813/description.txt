The FactorialCalculator class is designed to calculate the factorial of the number passed to its constructor as a parameter.
But it is implemented incorrectly and you need to fix it.

Requirements:
1. The FactorialCalculator class must support the Callable interface.
2. The call method of the FactorialCalculator class must return the result of executing the factorial method.
3. The call method of the FactorialCalculator class must be public.
4. The number field of the FactorialCalculator class must be private.
